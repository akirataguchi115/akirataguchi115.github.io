Hello, Jekyll! I'll keep this short since my fuse has been burnt ages ago with this framework. This blog post is about the journey I went through just to get a simple blog, that is not Blogger, up and running.

For some reason I spent one week doing this: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/). Turns out this is just a way to teach the developer to use Jekyll bare bones without default themes. I spawned a few issues and one pull request regarding the process cuz it turns out it isn't as polished as I thought it would be. Also last commit 5 days ago does not scream depcecated to me:

If someone knows how to apply images here let me know.

I wonder if Matz has any plans to make Ruby a greener language.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
print_hello('Ruby')
{% endhighlight %}
